# javasysmon https://github.com/jezhumble/javasysmon
A correct version of javasysmon without bugs , all the forks of JavaSysmon have bugs or don't work on Windows 7 [ This is a mix of several jar files i found and maked a one in all pack :) ] . 

Using it in various projects until JavaSysmon Repository resolves the bugs .
